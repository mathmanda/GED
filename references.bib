  abstract={In this paper we present a general procedure that allows for the reduction or expansion of any network (considered as a weighted graph). This procedure maintains the spectrum of the network's adjacency matrix up to a set of eigenvalues known beforehand from its graph structure. This procedure can be used to establish new equivalence relations on the class of all weighted graphs (networks) where two graphs are equivalent if they can be reduced to the same graph. Additionally, dynamical networks (or any finite dimensional, discrete time dynamical system) can be analysed using isospectral transformations. By doing so we obtain stronger results regarding the global stability (strong synchronization) of dynamical networks when compared with other standard methods.}

In particular we compute the synchronization time for different typesof networks and different dynamics. We show that the main dependence of the synchronization time is on the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, in contrast to other proposals in terms of the spectrum of the adjacency matrix. Then, this topological property becomes the most relevant for the dynamics.}

not suffice to characterize the synchronization of systems evolving
on them. We prove that, for any given degree sequence satisfying
certain conditions, there exists a connected graph having that degree
sequence for which the first nontrivial eigenvalue of the graph
Laplacian is arbitrarily close to zero. Consequently, complex
dynamical systems defined on such graphs have poor synchronization
properties. The result holds under quite mild assumptions,
and shows that there exists classes of random, scale-free, regular,
small-world, and other common network architectures which
impede synchronization. The proof is based on a construction
that also serves as an algorithm for building nonsynchronizing
networks having a prescribed degree distribution.}

  abstract={We report on some recent developments in the search for optimal network topologies. First we review some basic concepts on spectral graph theory, including adjacency and Laplacian matrices, paying special attention to the topological implications of having large spectral gaps. We also introduce related concepts such as 'expanders', Ramanujan, and Cage graphs. Afterwards, we discuss two different dynamical features of Networks, synchronizability and flow of random walkers, so that they are optimized if the corresponding Laplacian matrix has a large spectral gap. From this, we show, by developing a numerical optimization algorithm, that maximum synchronizability and fast random walk spreading are obtained for a particular type of extremely homogeneous regular networks, with long loops and poor modular structure, that we call entangled networks. These turn out to be related to Ramanujan and Cage graphs. We argue also that these graphs are very good finite-size approximations to Bethe lattices, and provide optimal or almost optimal solutions to many other problems, for instance searchability in the presence of congestion or performance of neural networks. Finally, we study how these results are modified when studying dynamical processes controlled by a normalized (weighted and directed) dynamics; much more heterogeneous graphs are optimal in this case. Finally, a critical discussion of the limitations and possible extensions of this work is presented.}

A successful approach to the problem of synchronization consists of modeling each member of the population as a phase oscillator. In this review, synchronization is analyzed in one of the most representative models of coupled phase oscillators, the Kuramoto model. A rigorous mathematical treatment, specific numerical methods, and many variations and extensions of the original model that have appeared in the last few years are presented. Relevant applications of the model in different contexts are also included.}
